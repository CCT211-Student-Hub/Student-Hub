# Student Hub

## Introducing Student Hub

Created by students, for students, Student Hub is a digital to-do list repository that is seamlessly accessible through any operating system with Python. Student Hub emerged from the need to keep track of assignments, upcoming deadlines, and daily tasks – activities that can quickly feel overwhelming for students with the busy nature of every semester. To combat the universal struggle of disorganization, Student Hub has made it easy for students to catalogue tasks for academic or daily use. Students can log due dates and flag the priority of each task, which are then displayed in an organized manner. By visualizing the number of tasks that need to be completed and categorizing tasks based on importance and urgency, Student Hub can help alleviate the potential stresses and academic downfalls that come with disorganization and procrastination, steering students towards academic success one task at a time.

## Running the app

To run the app, run the command `python app.py`, which will start the program, creating a `student_hub.db` database file if one does not exist.

## Sample database

To demonstrate how Student Hub works from the perspective of a student, we have provided a script to create a sample database prefilled with courses and tasks. To run this script, run the command `python populate_db.py`. 

⚠️ Note that this will delete the existing database, meaning all exisiting work will be lost.
